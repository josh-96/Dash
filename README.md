## Getting started

Welcome to our Diabetes Prediction Dashboard! This tool is designed to help you assess the risk of diabetes based on several key input variables. The following features are considered in the prediction model:

1. HighChol (High Cholesterol):

This is a binary variable indicating whether you have high cholesterol (1) or not (0).

2. BMI (Body Mass Index):

BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's height and weight. To calculate your BMI, use the following formula:

BMI = (Weight in Kg)/(Height in meters)^2
 
Make sure to input weight in kilograms and height in meters for accurate results.

3. Sex: (Male or Female)

This variable represents the sex of the individual.

4. HeartDiseaseorAttack:

Another binary variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of a history of heart disease or heart attack.


5. PhysHlth (Physical Health):

PhysHlth represents the number of days an individual has felt ill during the past month, ranging from 0 to 30.


This dashboard leverages these input variables to provide you with insights into the likelihood of developing diabetes. The goal is to empower you with information that can guide healthier lifestyle choices and early intervention.

To get started, input the relevant values for each variable, ensuring accurate data for the BMI calculation. Once you've provided the necessary information, the dashboard will generate a prediction regarding the risk of diabetes.

Remember, this tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It serves as a proactive measure for personal health awareness. If you have concerns about your health, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional.
